        &nbsp&nbsp&nbspHi, I'm Jesse Martin, I read about the idea for this clock on a kickstarter page. I thought the idea behind it was really cool, I'm a big fan of simple looks and this clock is just about as simple as it gets. It may not be the most practical way to tell time, but as soon as i saw this idea on kickstarter, I knew I had to try to make one myself. I've really enjoyed working on this project and I feel like I've learned a lot about how webpages and apps work.<br><br>

        &nbsp&nbsp&nbspAnyway, I hope you enjoy playing around with this app, maybe show it around to your friends (it is kind of a cool conversation starter in my opinion). If you ever see, or think of a cool idea/concept like this I definitely recommend you pursue it, you WILL learn something and you WILL have fun (albeit not without some frustration, this is a part of life). <br><br>

        &nbsp&nbsp&nbspIf you enjoy this app you can shoot me an e-mail at Jesse@JayMartMedia.com, I'd really appreciate it.<br><br>
